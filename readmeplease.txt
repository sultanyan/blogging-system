Hey.
This is a simple, but nice, clean and working nice cms. 
The most important thing is that i build it all by myself.
This is kinda my second a-z project, so, please, do not judge me :D
And yes, i know there can be bugs and my code is a little bit messy, but

IT IS NOT A 'SHITCODE', IT'S MY UNIQUE STYLE.

As a huge fan of open source things, i let you to change, update, and give it to a third party (and so on) this gizmo.

Best regards, Mher Margaryan
